# Sum-Problem
Given an array of integers, return the smallest set of indices of numbers such that they add up to a target number. You may not use the same element twice.
 
           Examples:
           [1,2,6,3,17,82,23,234] -> 26
           Solution [3,6]
 
           [1,2,6,3,17,82,23,234] -> 40
           Solution [4,6]
 
           [1,2,6,3,17,82,23,234] -> 23
           Solution [6]
